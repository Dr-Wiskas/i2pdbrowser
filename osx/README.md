## How-to
NOTE: very very drafty script

run build.sh in one terminal
run ./i2pd_2.16.0_osx/i2pd in another terminal

Open FF-ESR without the use of run.sh, with ./FirefoxESR/Contents/MacOS/firefox --profilemanager

Create a new profile, save it in this ./osx dir and name the profile "i2pdbb". Quit it again.

Firefox ESR is now configured and i2pd is running. When you want to run FF-ESR now, execute it through the run.sh script.

## TODO:
Place i2pd addressbook in datadir.
